Skype Launcher for Kodi
=======================

This is an extremely simple script for Kodi that simply launches Skype on Linux only. It literally just runs the application binary at /usr/bin/skypeforlinux.

Installation
------------
This plugin is not in any repository, it must be installed by the "Install from zip file" option. Download the archive from github releases.
